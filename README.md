## Hi, I'm Chris !

🎓 I'm a Computer Science student at Oregon State University passionate about **backend** and **full stack development**.

### 💼 Recent Experience

🔧 **Software Engineering Intern @ [SailPoint](https://www.sailpoint.com/)** Summer 2025
Developed a MVP for SailPoint to monitor new features being rolled out from 500+ million data points and configured an alert service when new features are correlated with errors per release version, resulting in 50% reduction of debugging and monitoring time for the on call engineers at SailPoint. 

### Current Projects

- 🌐 Personal Website – A portfolio to showcase my work and skills *(link coming soon)*
- 🛒 Grocery Store Tracker – A tool to help users manage shopping more efficiently. *(in progress)*
  My plan:
  - Use APIs such as Kroger to track prices in (almost real) time. Cache the results in a database.
  - Find the cheapest option for the selection. Give suggestions using machine learning.
  - Develop an order history and suggested items list on the application.
  - Utilize maps API (such as google maps) to also give directions to store locations within a certain radius. 

### Goals

I'm currently seeking **Software Engineering Internships for Summer 2026** to continue growing as a developer and work on impactful projects.
