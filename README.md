## Hi visitor, Chris here !

I'm a Computer Science student at Oregon State University (Go Beavs!) and I am currently a Software Engineer Co-op at @ [Curriculum Associates](https://www.curriculumassociates.com/). I'm passionate about **backend** and **full stack development**. 

### Upcoming Experience

- Software Engineering Intern *(Summer 2026)* @ [SailPoint](https://www.sailpoint.com/)

### Recent Professional Experience

- Teaching Assistant *(Fall 2025)* @ Oregon State University
- Software Engineering Intern *(Summer 2025)* @ [SailPoint](https://www.sailpoint.com/)

### Current Projects

- 🏋️ A calorie tracker that authenticates user's using Auth0 & JWT coookies in the backend *(in progress)*
- 💵 A cost of living comparison checker using python and flask *(in progress)*
- ✨ Feel free to look around on the other cool projects I'm involved in!

### Goals

I really want to work in either backend of fullstack development upon graduation as a Software Engineer! 
I'm currently seeking **Software Engineering Internships for Fall 2026** to continue growing as a developer and work on impactful projects.
